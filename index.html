<p>Proposal

This page is intended to act as a toolkit-generator for producing structures of aesthetic encounter with the contours of prediction and reconstruction shaping urban spaces. Organized around a set of prompts and questions, it is intended as a script for contemplation and production of a new vocabulary to engage with the timeliness of urban conditions.
